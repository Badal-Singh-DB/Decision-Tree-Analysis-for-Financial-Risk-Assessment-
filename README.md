# Decision-Tree-Analysis-for-Financial-Risk-Assessment-

This project implements a Decision Tree Analysis system for Financial Risk Assessment using C++. It includes a Tree Diff Algorithm, Dynamic Programming optimization, and machine learning techniques for market trend prediction.

## Features

- Tree Diff Algorithm for comparing financial decision trees
- Dynamic Programming optimization for efficient tree comparisons
- Machine Learning model for market prediction
- Data processing and visualization tools

## Prerequisites

- C++17 compatible compiler
- CMake (version 3.12 or higher)
- Eigen3 library
- Google Test framework

2. Create a build directory:

mkdir build cd build


3. Run CMake and build the project:

cmake .. make


## Running the Application

After building the project, you can run the main application:


./FinancialRiskAssessment


## Running Tests

To run the unit tests:


./RunTests


## Configuration

The application uses a configuration file `config.ini` located in the project root directory. Make sure to set the appropriate values before running the application.
